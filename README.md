# ClearCache

This is a script to help you automate clearing the cache files of the following:
<ul> 
  <li> Internet Explorer</li>
  <li> Google Chrome</li>
  <li> Mozilla Firefox</li>
  <li> Microsoft Service Terminal (SCCM)</li>
  <li> Anything that you want, just tweak the code a little</li>
</ul>

The script will extract the source from a CSV file.

The batch file will help to run the script as it is set to execute according to the path. You will need to invoke the batch file in task scheduler for it to run on the desired time. For Mac OS, you can just use CRON as alternative.

The log file has been created in a way that it can be viewed both in notepad or CM Trace. or probably any other preferred viewer.

Have fun using it and/or edit it. Feel free to fork and improve it.
